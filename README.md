# Fare Estimator – Frontend

This repository contains the **frontend code** for the **Fare Estimator** project, a web application designed to help students and travelers calculate fair travel fares based on distance, current fuel prices, and reasonable driver margins.

The frontend interacts seamlessly with the hosted backend, providing a fully functional live application.

## 🌐 Live Demo
